## 🔮 Future Improvements

If I had more time ⏳, I would enhance the project by adding:

- ⚠️ **Error Handling** — To manage failures gracefully and improve user experience
- 📜 **Logging** — For better monitoring, debugging, and tracking of app behavior
- 🧪 **Unit Tests (UT)** — To ensure reliability and prevent bugs during future changes
- 🗂️ **Better Code Organization** — Structuring code clearly to improve readability and maintenance
- ✂️ **Refactoring** — Splitting large functions or files into smaller, reusable pieces
- ✅ **Improved Validations** — To make the app more robust against invalid or harmful inputs
- 🏷️ **Clearer Naming Conventions** — For folders, files, and functions to make the code easier to navigate
